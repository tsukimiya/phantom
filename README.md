## ✨ What is Phantom?

Phantom is a powerful CLI tool that dramatically boosts your development productivity by making Git worktrees simple and intuitive. Run multiple tasks in isolated environments simultaneously and achieve true multitask development. Built for the next generation of parallel development workflows, including AI-powered coding with multiple agents.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Simple worktree management** - Create and manage Git worktrees with intuitive commands
- 🔄 **True multitasking** - Create separate working directories per branch and run multiple tasks simultaneously
- 🎯 **Execute commands from anywhere** - Run commands in any worktree with `phantom exec <worktree> <command>`
- 🪟 **Built-in tmux integration** - Open worktrees in new panes or windows
- 🔍 **Interactive selection with fzf** - Use built-in fzf option for worktree selection
- 🎮 **Shell completion** - Full autocomplete support for Fish, Zsh, and Bash
- 🐙 **GitHub Integration** - Create worktrees directly from GitHub PRs and issues
- 🤖 **MCP Integration** - AI autonomously manages worktrees for parallel development
- 🔍 **PR Review Interface** - Review worktree differences locally using [difit](https://github.com/yoshiko-pg/difit) (experimental)
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** - Minimal external dependencies

## 🚀 Installation

### Using Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install aku11i/tap/phantom
```

> **Note:** Shell completions for Fish and Zsh are installed automatically with Homebrew. For Bash completion, see the [Shell Completion](#shell-completion) section below.

#### Using npm

```bash
npm install -g @aku11i/phantom
```

## 🤔 Why Phantom?

Git worktrees are powerful but require manual management of paths and branches. Also, navigating between multiple worktrees is cumbersome. Phantom eliminates these problems:

```bash
# Without Phantom
git worktree add -b feature-awesome ../project-feature-awesome origin/main
cd ../project-feature-awesome

# With Phantom
phantom create feature-awesome --shell
```

### How Phantom Works

When you run `phantom create feature-awesome`, a new Git worktree named `feature-awesome` is created in `.git/phantom/worktrees/`.
All worktrees created with phantom are centrally managed in this location.

```
your-project/    # Git repository
├── .git/
│   └── phantom/
│       └── worktrees/        # Phantom-managed directory
│           ├── feature-awesome/  # branch name = worktree name
│           ├── bugfix-login/     # another worktree
│           └── hotfix-critical/  # yet another worktree
└── ...
```

You can also customize the worktree location using the `worktreesDirectory` configuration option in `phantom.config.json`. This allows you to store worktrees in any location you prefer.

This convention means you never need to remember worktree paths - just use the branch name for easy worktree operations.

### ✈️ Features for a Comfortable Development Experience

Phantom provides perfect functionality as a command-line tool. Developers feel the trust and comfort of flying first class.

#### Shell Completion

Phantom supports full shell completion for Fish, Zsh, Bash, and PowerShell (pwsh). Use tab key to complete commands and worktree names.

When installed via Homebrew, completions for Fish and Zsh are installed automatically. For Bash, you need to manually set up the completion:

```bash
# Prerequisites: bash-completion v2 must be installed

# For Bash (add to your .bashrc or .bash_profile)
eval "$(phantom completion bash)"
```

For PowerShell (pwsh):

```powershell
# Load into current session
phantom completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

# To persist, append the output to your PowerShell profile (e.g. $PROFILE)
```

#### tmux Integration

When creating worktrees, you can use tmux to open them in new windows or panes. This allows you to manage multiple work environments simultaneously.

```bash
# Create and open worktree in new window
phantom create feature-x --tmux
# Create with split panes
phantom create feature-y --tmux-vertical
phantom create feature-z --tmux-horizontal

# Open existing worktrees in tmux
phantom shell feature-x --tmux
phantom shell feature-y --tmux-v

# Result: Multiple worktrees displayed simultaneously, each allowing independent work
```

#### Editor Integration

Phantom works seamlessly with editors like VS Code and Cursor. You can specify an editor to open worktrees.

```bash
# Open with VS Code
phantom create feature --exec "code ."

# Or open existing worktree
phantom exec feature code .

# Open with Cursor
phantom create feature --exec "cursor ."
phantom exec feature cursor .
```

#### fzf Integration

Interactive search with fzf allows quick worktree selection.

```bash
# Open shell with fzf selection
phantom shell --fzf

# Delete with fzf selection
phantom delete --fzf
```

### MCP Integration

Phantom provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. AI coding assistants can autonomously create and manage worktrees to develop multiple features in parallel.

After completing the MCP server setup, try giving your AI agent a prompt like this.
The AI agent will create two worktrees and implement Express and Hono apps in each.

> Create 2 variations of a simple hello world app using Express and Hono, each in their own worktree. Make sure each can be started with npm start and served on a different URL.

See [MCP Integration Guide](./docs/mcp.md) for detailed setup and usage.

## 🔍 Basic Usage

### Create a new worktree

```bash
phantom create feature-awesome

phantom list
```

### Start a new shell in the worktree

```bash
phantom shell feature-awesome

# Start development work

# Exit the shell when done
exit
```

### Run commands in any worktree

```bash
phantom exec feature-awesome {command to run}
# Example: phantom exec feature-awesome npm run build
```

### Review code with GitHub-like interface

```bash
# Review worktree against default branch
phantom review feature-awesome

# Review against specific branch
phantom review feature-awesome --base main

# Interactive worktree selection
phantom review --fzf
```

### Clean up when done

```bash
phantom delete feature-awesome
```
